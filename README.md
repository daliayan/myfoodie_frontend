# MyFoodie || Ruby on Rails + Javascript

This Ruby on Rails backend, Javascript frontend project called Taste This City (myfoodie on Github)! The origin of this application started here: 

https://github.com/daliayan/backend.git

There was an error that created a disconnection in the application so I created a new repository, and brought the bones of the old application over to this githome. Moments after typing the words above, I encountered the same error that made me move my application. Here's the link to my old, again broken application: 

https://github.com/daliayan/foodie_app

Thankfully, if you're still reading this I was able to transfer my application over to its new home.

## Description of the Application
This application is a website where I stored cities and restaurants I've visited while traveling the world. Initially, I wanted to create a generic website for restaurants to be added to - but I decided towards the end I wanted it to be more personalized. The idea of Taste This City was born.

## Installation

Use this link to clone my GitHub repository:
```bash
gh repo clone daliayan/myfoodie
```

From there cd into the backend folder of the application. Once in the correct folder run the following command in your terminal to ensure you have the required gems to run the application:
```bash
bundle install
```

Following this step, you can run the following command to start up the backend server:
```bash
rails s
```

Now that you have the backend server retrieving data in your webpage, you cd back into the foodie folder. Here you navigate into the frontend folder using cd frontend. Now that you're in the correct folder, you can enter the following command into the terminal to start up the application.
```bash
explorer.exe index.html
```
Finally, you can look at restaurants in different cities and contribute to this database.
